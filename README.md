scriptographer scripts .js
==========================
javascript I wrote for use with the Scriptographer plugin for Adobe Illustrator version <= CS5
* These are scripts that I find useful for cartography in AI, similar to the ones found [here.](http://kelsocartography.com/blog/?tag=script)
* Some of these scripts were developed with help from [Alex Blackwood](pxqxbxd@gmail.com)
* The transFormEach.js script was created by [Shanfan Huang](http://shanfanhuang.com), the visual designer.
