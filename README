scriptographer scripts .js
==========================
javascript for use with the Scriptographer plugin for Adobe Illustrator version <= CS5
   *these are scripts that I find useful for cartography in AI, similar to the ones found [here.](http://kelsocartography.com/blog/?tag=script)
   *some of these scripts were developed with help from Alex Blackwood (pxqxbxd [at] gmail.com)
   *the transFormEach.js script was created by Shanfan Huang, the visual designer. http://shanfanhuang.com
